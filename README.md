SF City Officials Authorizations
================================

### Open Legislation Hackathon Project for CFA 2013

This project has a proof of concept app that lists the City Officials, and the powers authorized to them
via the SF City Code.

Although the data was hand-gleaned in this version, once the Code is structured via XML (or similar),
we could generate much of the data automatically.

This was done by James Gill (jagill) and Colin McCormick (colinmccormick).
